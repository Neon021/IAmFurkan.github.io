# Overview

<p>In this project I've created a fully-fledged working blog page made in ASP.NET CORE MVC w/ EF Core that supports CRUD operations, Authorization, E-mail service and Pagination!</p>

# Application Architecture
- As mentioned above, I've used the MVC Model -which stands for Model, Controller, and View- for this project.
- I've used the *Repository* pattern in order to ensure uncoupling between services and scalability.
- On top of that we've got <code>Data.FileManager</code> to help manage images in our application.

# Technologies
- ASP.NET CORE 5
- Entity Framework
- SQL Server
- PhotoSauce.MagicScaler
